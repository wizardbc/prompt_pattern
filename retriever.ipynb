However, having users continually perform the manual steps dictated by LLM output is tedious and error-prone.\",\"15\":\"\\\\\\\\section{A Catalog of Prompt Patterns for Conversational LLMs}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsection{The Output Automater Pattern}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsubsection{Structure and Key Ideas}\\\\nFundamental contextual statements:\\\\n% \\\\\\\\begin{enumerate}\\\\n%     \\\\\\\\item  Whenever you produce an output that has at least one step to take and the following properties (alternatively, always do this)\\\\n%     \\\\\\\\item Produce an executable artifact of type X that will automate these steps\\\\n% \\\\\\\\end{enumerate}\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{center}\\\\n\\\\\\\\vspace{6pt}\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{tabular}{|p{7.8cm}|}\\\\n  \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n  \\\\\\\\cellcolor[gray]{0.8}Contextual Statements \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n  Whenever you produce an output that has at least one step to take and the following properties (alternatively, always do this) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n  Produce an executable artifact of type X that will automate these steps  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{tabular}\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{center}\\\\n\\\\nThe first part of the pattern identifies the situations under which automation should be generated. A simple approach is to state that the output includes at least two steps to take and that an automation artifact should be produced. The scoping is up to the user, but helps prevent producing an output automation scripts in cases where running the output automation script will take more user effort than performing the original steps produced in the output. The scope can be limited to outputs requiring more than a certain number of steps.\\\\n\\\\nThe next part of this pattern provides a concrete statement of the type of output the LLM should output to perform the automation. For example, ``produce a Python script\\'\\' gives the LLM a concrete understanding to translate the general steps into equivalent steps in Python. The automation artifact should be concrete and must be something that the LLM associates with the action of ``automating a sequence of steps\\'\\'.\",\"16\":\"\\\\\\\\section{A Catalog of Prompt Patterns for Conversational LLMs}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsection{The Output Automater Pattern}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsubsection{Example Implementation}\\\\nA sample of this prompt pattern applied to code snippets generated by the ChatGPT LLM is shown below:\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{displayquote}\\\\n    ``From now on, whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a Python script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code.\\'\\'\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{displayquote}\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern is particularly effective in software engineering as a common task for software engineers using LLMs is to then copy\\\\/paste the outputs into multiple files. Some tools, such as Copilot, insert limited snippets directly into the section of code that the coder is working with, but tools, such as ChatGPT, do not provide these facilities. This automation trick is also effective at creating scripts for running commands on a terminal, automating cloud operations, or reorganizing files on a file system.\\\\n\\\\nThis pattern is a powerful complement for any system that can be computer controlled. The LLM can provide a set of steps that should be taken on the computer-controlled system and then the output can be translated into a script that allows the computer controlling the system to automatically take the steps. This is a direct pathway to allowing LLMs, such as ChatGPT, to integrate quality into---and to control---new computing systems that have a known scripting interface.\",\"17\":\"\\\\\\\\section{A Catalog of Prompt Patterns for Conversational LLMs}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsection{The Output Automater Pattern}\\\\n\\\\\\\\subsubsection{Consequences}\\\\nAn important usage consideration of this pattern is that the automation artifact must be defined concretely. Without a concrete meaning for how to ``automate\\'\\' the steps, the LLM often states that it ``can\\'t automate things\\'\\' since that is beyond its capabilities. LLMs typically accept requests to produce code, however, so the goal is to instruct the LLM to generate text\\\\/code, which can be executed to automate something. This subtle distinction in meaning is important to help an LLM disambiguate the prompt meaning.\\\\n\\\\nOne caveat of the \\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater} pattern is the LLM needs sufficient conversational context to generate an automation artifact that is functional in the target context, such as the file system of a project on a Mac vs. Windows computer. This pattern works best when the full context needed for the automation is contained within the conversation, \\\\\\\\textit{e.g.}, when a software application is generated from scratch using the conversation and all actions on the local file system are performed using a sequence of generated automation artifacts rather than manual actions unknown to the LLM. Alternatively, self-contained sequences of steps work well, such as ``how do I find the list of open ports on my Mac computer\\'\\'.\\\\n\\\\nIn some cases, the LLM may produce a long output with multiple steps and not include an automation artifact. This omission may arise for various reasons, including exceeding the output length limitation the LLM supports. A simple workaround for this situation is to remind the LLM via a follow-on prompt, such as ``But you didn\\'t automate it\\'\\', which provides the context that the automation artifact was omitted and should be generated.\\\\n\\\\nAt this point in the evolution of LLMs, the \\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater} pattern is best employed by users who can read and understand the generated automation artifact. LLMs can (and do) produce inaccuracies in their output, so blindly accepting and executing an automation artifact carries significant risk. Although this pattern may alleviate the user from performing certain manual steps, it does not alleviate their responsibility to understand the actions they undertake using the output. When users execute automation scripts, therefore they assume responsibility for the outcomes.\"}}'"

This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Meta Language Creation} pattern, which focuses on creating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This pattern is useful when the default input language is ill-suited for expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Output Customization} category focuses on constraining or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other properties of the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in this category include\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater}, \\\\\\\\textit{Persona}, \\\\\\\\textit{Visualization Generator}, \\\\\\\\textit{Recipe}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Template} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater} pattern allows the user to create scripts that can automate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should perform. The \\\\\\\\textit{Persona} pattern gives the LLM a persona or role to play when generating output. The \\\\\\\\textit{Visualization Generator} pattern allows the user to generate visualizations by producing textual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other AI-based image generators, like\\\\nDALL-E~\\\\\\\\cite{openai-dalle2}. The \\\\\\\\textit{Recipe} pattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actions to realize a stated end result, possibly with partially known information or constraints. The \\\\\\\\textit{Template} pattern allows the user to specify a template for the output, which the LLM fills in with content.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Error Identification} category focuses on identifying and resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Fact Check List} and \\\\\\\\textit{Reflection} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Fact Check List} pattern requires the LLM to generate a list of facts the output depends on that should be fact-checked. The \\\\\\\\textit{Reflection} pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its output and identify any errors.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Prompt Improvement} category focuses on improving the quality of the input and output. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Question Refinement}, \\\\\\\\textit{Alternative Approaches}, \\\\\\\\textit{Cognitive Verifier}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Refusal Breaker} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Question Refinement} pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version of the user\\'s question. The \\\\\\\\textit{Alternative Approaches} pattern requires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishing a user-specified task. The \\\\\\\\textit{Cognitive Verifier} pattern instructs the LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions for the user to answer before combining the answers to the subquestions and producing an answer to the overall question. The \\\\\\\\textit{Refusal Breaker} pattern requires the LLM to automatically reword the user\\'s question when it refuses to produce an answer.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Interaction category} focuses on the interaction between the user and the LLM. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Flipped Interaction}, \\\\\\\\textit{Game Play}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Infinite Generation} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Flipped Interaction} pattern requires the LLM to ask questions rather than generate output. The \\\\\\\\textit{Game Play} pattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of a game. The \\\\\\\\textit{Infinite Generation} pattern requires the LLM to generate output indefinitely without the user having to reenter the generator prompt each time.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the \\\\\\\\textbf{Context Control} category focuses on controlling the contextual information in which the LLM operates. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Context Manager} pattern, which allows the user to specify the context for the LLM\\'s output.\\\\n\\\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt patterns using the pattern form discussed in Section~\\\\\\\\ref{patternform}.\\\"}}\"\n",

Table~\\\\\\\\ref{class:table} outlines the initial classifications for the catalog of prompt patterns we identified in our work with ChatGPT thus far.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{table}[htbp]\\\\n\\\\\\\\caption{Classifying Prompt Patterns}\\\\n{\\\\\\\\large\\\\\\\\raggedright\\\\n\\\\\\\\centering\\\\n\\\\\\\\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{4.4cm}|}\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline \\\\\\\\cellcolor[gray]{0.8}\\\\\\\\textbf{Pattern Category} & \\\\\\\\cellcolor[gray]{0.8}\\\\\\\\textbf{Prompt Pattern} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf {Input Semantics} & \\\\\\\\textit{Meta Language Creation} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf {Output} & \\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n \\\\\\\\textbf {Customization}& \\\\\\\\textit{Persona} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n & \\\\\\\\textit{Visualization Generator} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n & \\\\\\\\textit{Recipe} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n & \\\\\\\\textit{Template} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{\\\\\\\\mbox{Error Identification}} & \\\\\\\\textit{Fact Check List} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\\\\\textit{Reflection} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf {Prompt} & \\\\\\\\textit{Question Refinement} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf {Improvement} & \\\\\\\\textit{Alternative Approaches} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\\\\\textit{Cognitive Verifier} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\\\\\textit{Refusal Breaker} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf {Interaction} & \\\\\\\\textit{Flipped Interaction} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\\\\\textit{Game Play} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\\\\\textit{Infinite Generation} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\textbf{Context Control} & \\\\\\\\textit{Context Manager} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\hline\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{tabular}\\\\n\\\\\\\\label{class:table}}\\\\n\\\\\\\\end{table}\\\\n As shown in this table, there are five categories of prompt patterns in our classification framework: \\\\\\\\textbf{Input Semantics}, \\\\\\\\textbf{Output Customization}, \\\\\\\\textbf{Error Identification}, \\\\\\\\textbf{Prompt Improvement}, and \\\\\\\\textbf{Interaction}, each of which is summarized below.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Input Semantics} category deals with how an LLM understands the input and how it translates the input into something it can use to generate output. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Meta Language Creation} pattern, which focuses on creating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This pattern is useful when the default input language is ill-suited for expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Output Customization} category focuses on constraining or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other properties of the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in this category include\\\\n\\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater}, \\\\\\\\textit{Persona}, \\\\\\\\textit{Visualization Generator}, \\\\\\\\textit{Recipe}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Template} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Output Automater} pattern allows the user to create scripts that can automate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should perform. The \\\\\\\\textit{Persona} pattern gives the LLM a persona or role to play when generating output. The \\\\\\\\textit{Visualization Generator} pattern allows the user to generate visualizations by producing textual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other AI-based image generators, like\\\\nDALL-E~\\\\\\\\cite{openai-dalle2}. The \\\\\\\\textit{Recipe} pattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actions to realize a stated end result, possibly with partially known information or constraints. The \\\\\\\\textit{Template} pattern allows the user to specify a template for the output, which the LLM fills in with content.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Error Identification} category focuses on identifying and resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Fact Check List} and \\\\\\\\textit{Reflection} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Fact Check List} pattern requires the LLM to generate a list of facts the output depends on that should be fact-checked. The \\\\\\\\textit{Reflection} pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its output and identify any errors.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Prompt Improvement} category focuses on improving the quality of the input and output. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Question Refinement}, \\\\\\\\textit{Alternative Approaches}, \\\\\\\\textit{Cognitive Verifier}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Refusal Breaker} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Question Refinement} pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version of the user\\'s question. The \\\\\\\\textit{Alternative Approaches} pattern requires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishing a user-specified task. The \\\\\\\\textit{Cognitive Verifier} pattern instructs the LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions for the user to answer before combining the answers to the subquestions and producing an answer to the overall question. The \\\\\\\\textit{Refusal Breaker} pattern requires the LLM to automatically reword the user\\'s question when it refuses to produce an answer.\\\\n\\\\nThe \\\\\\\\textbf{Interaction category} focuses on the interaction between the user and the LLM. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Flipped Interaction}, \\\\\\\\textit{Game Play}, and \\\\\\\\textit{Infinite Generation} patterns. The \\\\\\\\textit{Flipped Interaction} pattern requires the LLM to ask questions rather than generate output. The \\\\\\\\textit{Game Play} pattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of a game. The \\\\\\\\textit{Infinite Generation} pattern requires the LLM to generate output indefinitely without the user having to reenter the generator prompt each time.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the \\\\\\\\textbf{Context Control} category focuses on controlling the contextual information in which the LLM operates. This category includes the \\\\\\\\textit{Context Manager} pattern, which allows the user to specify the context for the LLM\\'s output.\\\\n\\\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt patterns using the pattern form discussed in Section~\\\\\\\\ref{patternform}.\\\"}}\"\n",
